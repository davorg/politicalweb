      <h2>About the Site</h2>
      <p>The web is becoming important to politics in the UK.</p>
      <p>More and more information about British politics is available on
        various web sites. Some of it is easy to find. Some of it isn't.
        Some of it is widely promoted. Some is pretty much hidden.</p>
      <p>Here on Political Web we intend to track down as much of this
        information as possible and make it easy for the public to find.</p>
      <p>We are starting with MPs and constituencies. We are trying to
        create a directory of web sites about either MPs or constituencies.</p>
      <p>Some of these web sites are created by or for the MPs themselves, but
        some sites are created by external organisations. For example, both
        the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/">BBC</a> and the
        <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics">Guardian</a> have a page
        of information about each MP. And then there are the very wonderful
        people at <a href="http://mysociety.org/">MySociety</a> who build
        interesting and useful sites like
        <a href="http://theyworkforyou.com/">TheyWorkForYou</a>.</p>
      <p>So that's what we've got for now. Type your postcode into the box
        on our <a href="/">front page</a> and you'll get back a list of
        useful web links about your constituency and your MP. This list
        is in a state of flux - we'll be adding to it over the forthcoming
        weeks.</p>

      <h2>Technical Stuff</h2>
      <p>The site is written using a standard
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29">LAMP
        software stack</a>. The operating system is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>
        (<a href="http://centos.org/">Centos</a>, to be precise), the web
        server is <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>, the database
        is <a href="http://mysql.com/">MySQL</a> and the code is written in
        <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> using the
        <a href="http://perldancer.org"/>Dancer</a> framework (with a little
        bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript">Javascript</a>
        on the side).</p>
